## Hi there 👋

- 🔭 I’m currently exploring advanced algorithms in **vector search**, including **nearest neighbor search** and **farthest neighbor search**, with a particular focus on **graph-based indexing structures**.
- 📝 I published a [paper](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/10679929) on **k-NN graph construction**, contributing to the field of high-dimensional data search.
- 🏆 I achieved the **Runner-up Award** in the **2024 SIGMOD Programming Contest**, where I worked on **Hybrid Vector Search** in high-dimensional spaces. The contest featured a **10-million-scale dataset** and evaluated performance on real-world scenarios.
- 💻 On GitHub, I’ve contributed to **NVIDIA’s RAFT** and **Zilliz’s Milvus**, supporting cutting-edge developments in the open-source community.
- 📫 How to reach me: **[jeffwang@stu.xmu.edu.cn](mailto:jeffwang@stu.xmu.edu.cn)**

💬 Feel free to ask me about vector search algorithms, graph-based indexing, or my experience in competitive programming and open-source contributions!
